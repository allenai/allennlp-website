        <p>
	Machine comprehension of texts longer than a single sentence often requires coreference resolution.
	However, most current reading comprehension benchmarks do not contain complex coreferential phenomena and hence fail
	to evaluate the ability of models to resolve coreference. We present a new crowdsourced
	dataset containing more than 24K span-selection questions that require resolving coreference among
	entities in about 4.7K English paragraphs from Wikipedia.

        AllenNLP provides an easy way for you to get started with this dataset, with a dataset reader that can be used with any model you
        design, and a reference implementation of the basline models used in the paper.  Find more details in the links
        below.
