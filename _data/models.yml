  description: |
    Machine Comprehension (MC) models answer natural language questions by selecting an answer span within an evidence text. The AllenNLP MC model is a reimplementation of [BiDAF (Seo et al, 2017)](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Bidirectional-Attention-Flow-for-Machine-Comprehen-Seo-Kembhavi/007ab5528b3bd310a80d553cccad4b78dc496b02), or Bi-Directional Attention Flow, a widely used MC baseline that achieved state-of-the-art accuracies on the [SQuAD dataset](https://rajpurkar.github.io/SQuAD-explorer/) in 2017. The AllenNLP BIDAF model achieves an EM score of 68.3 on the SQuAD dev set, just slightly ahead of the original BIDAF system's score of 67.7, while also training at a 10x speedup (4 hours on a p2.xlarge).

  description: |
    Textual Entailment (TE) models take a pair of sentences and predict whether the facts in the first necessarily imply the facts in the second one. The AllenNLP TE model is a re-implementation of the [decomposable attention model (Parikh et al, 2017)](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/A-Decomposable-Attention-Model-for-Natural-Languag-Parikh-T%C3%A4ckstr%C3%B6m/07a9478e87a8304fc3267fa16e83e9f3bbd98b27), a widely used TE baseline that was state-of-the-art on the [SNLI dataset](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/snli/) in late 2016. The AllenNLP TE model achieves an accuracy of 86.4% on the SNLI 1.0 test dataset, a 2% improvement on most publicly available implementations and a similar score as the original paper. Rather than pre-trained Glove vectors, this model uses [ELMo embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.05365), which are completely character based and account for the 2% improvement.

    Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) models recover the latent predicate argument structure of a sentence. SRL builds representations that answer basic questions about sentence meaning, including "who" did "what" to “whom," etc. The AllenNLP SRL model is a reimplementation of [a deep BiLSTM model (He et al, 2017)](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Deep-Semantic-Role-Labeling-What-Works-and-What-s-He-Lee/a3ccff7ad63c2805078b34b8514fa9eab80d38e9). The implemented model closely matches the published model but replaces GloVe embeddings with ELMo representations, achieving an F1 of 84.9% on [English Ontonotes 5.0 dataset using the CONLL 2011/12 shared task format](http://cemantix.org/data/ontonotes.html). These results are currently state of the art for this task.

  description: |
    Coreference resolution is the task of finding all expressions that refer to the same entity in a text. It is an important step for many higher level NLP tasks that involve natural language understanding, such as document summarization, question answering and information extraction. Our implementation is based on [End-to-End Coreference Resolution (Lee et al, 2017)](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/End-to-end-Neural-Coreference-Resolution-Lee-He/3f2114893dc44eacac951f148fbff142ca200e83)—a neural model which considers all possible spans in the document as potential mentions and learns distributions over possible anteceedents for each span. This approach achieved state-of-the-art results on the [Ontonotes 5.0](http://cemantix.org/data/ontonotes.html) dataset in early 2017. The AllenNLP implementation achives 63.0% F1 on the CoNLL test set. Please note that this model does not include speaker features (impractical for general use), variational dropout (currently difficult to implement in Pytorch) or data augmentation and considers 100 anteceedents rather than 250 due to memory constraints.

This model uses [ELMo embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.05365), which are completely character based and improves single model performance from 92.6 F1 to 94.11 F1 on the Penn Tree bank, a 20% relative error reduction.

This demo is an implementation of a neural model for dependency parsing using biaffine classifiers on top of a bidirectional LSTM based on Deep Biaffine Attention for Neural Dependency Parsing (Dozat, 2017). The parser is trained on the PTB 3.0 dataset using Stanford dependencies, achieving 95.57% and 94.44% unlabeled and labeled attachement score using gold POS tags. For predicted POS tags, the model achieves 94.81% UAS and 92.86% LAS respectively.
