                  <h3>A Note on Non-determinism</h3>
                  <p class="t-sm">It is well known (see <a href="https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Reporting-Score-Distributions-Makes-a-Difference-P-Reimers-Gurevych/0eae432f7edacb262f3434ecdb2af707b5b06481" target="_blank">Reimers and Gurevych, 2017</a>) that multiple runs of probabilistic deep learning algorithms can have large variance in overall scores.  Ideally this variance could be controlled by setting random-number generator seeds, and others would be able to retrain models with reproducible results.  Unfortunately, some CuDNN methods are non-deterministic (see section 2.5 of the <a href="https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/sdk/pdf/cuDNN-Developer-Guide.pdf" target="_blank">CuDNN Developer's Guide</a>) and the rest are only deterministic on the same architecture, with the same number of GPU multiprocessors, and using the same version of CuDNN.</p>
                  <p class="t-sm">We provide the best models we trained.  In other words, we have trained our models multiple times and selected the best result.  Please keep in mind that if you retrain any of the following models, you are likely to end up with a slightly worse evaluation.</p>

                  <h2>How to Contribute</h2>
                  <p>
                    AllenNLP wants more near state-of-the-art NLP models and is looking for contributions.
                    Not only will your model be listed here and be easily accessible to other users of AllenNLP, but we'll even help build a visualization and host a demo.

                    To contribute a model:
                    <ol class="formatted">
                      <li>Put your code in a GitHub repo with instructions for running it</li>
                      <li>Host the trained <code>model.tar.gz</code> file somewhere accessible by HTTP</li>
                      <li><a href = "https://github.com/allenai/allennlp/issues">Open an issue</a> with the above links</a></li>
                    </ol>
                  </p>
